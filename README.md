# Course Manager (Full Stack React, Node, Express and Sequelize with REST API)

Purpose  - The purpose of this application is to allow users to manage course information. This functionality is provided by two halves: a REST API which interacts with the Sequelize ORM to services requests for course and user information, and a client implemented through React to provide users with an interface through which they can perform actions such as course creation and deletion, as well as viewing and updating course information. Users can also sign up to the site, as well as sign in, which authenticates them and allows them to perform protected actions.

Implementation - The implementation details of both the REST API as well as the React client are provided by separate README.md files located within their respective directories.

How To Run the Application - To run the application download the project files, and then open two terminals. In the first terminal, navigate to the 'api' folder from the root directory of the project and run 'npm install' to install the REST API's dependencies, then run 'npm start' to run the REST API. In the second terminal, navigate to the 'client' folder from the root directory and run 'npm install' to install the client's dependencies, and then run 'npm start' to run the client.
